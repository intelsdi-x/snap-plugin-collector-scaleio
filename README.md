## Getting Started

### System Requirements

* [golang 1.6+](https://golang.org/dl/) (needed only for building)

### Installation

#### Download File plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at the plugin's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-scaleio/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-scaleio  
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/intelsdi-x/`:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-scaleio.git
```

Build the plugin by running make within the cloned repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `./build/`

### Configuration and Usage
First, be sure that you've familiarized yourself with the Snap framework by reading the
[Getting Started documentation](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap#getting-started).

This plugin requires several config options to run properly:

**Required**
* `gateway`: This is the URL of the gateway server.
* `username` and `password`: A username and password with the appropriate access to the REST API

**Optional**
* `verifySSL`: If set to `false` this disables SSL validation. This should not be used in production.

A full config example is below:

```
"/intel/scaleio": {
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "gateway": "https://my-cluster",
    "verifySSL": false
}
```

## Documentation

### Collected Metrics
List of metrics collected by this plugin can be found in [METRICS.md file](METRICS.md).  

All metrics are exposed with a dynamic namespace that encompasses each StoragePool. You can collect metrics from all of them or specify a storage pool that you are interested by putting its name instead wildcard - see how to specify the instance of dynamic metric in [Snap framework documentation](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/docs/TASKS.md#collect).

### Examples
There is an example config found in the [examples directory](examples/file-collect.json).
